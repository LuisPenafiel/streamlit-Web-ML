# Diabetes_ DTC_Streamlit
## Case
Using our data of diabetes, processed data and model we will create a webpage for Diabetes Prediction Using a Trained Model
## Instructions
#### Step 1: Train a new model or choose the one from the previous project
In the Deployment with Flask module, we searched for a dataset and trained a model that we later used in a web application developed in Flask to deploy in Render. In this project, you can use the same model and change only the web application, or find another dataset and train a new model.

#### Step 2: Develop a web application using Streamlit
With the knowledge acquired in this module, develop an interface to be able to use the model. Style it as you see fit, and note any external resources you have used for development.

#### Step 3: Integrate the model and the application in Render
Create a free service in Render and integrate the work you have done to be able to deploy the web application online. Don't forget to include the link to the service in your repository.
